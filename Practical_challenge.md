# Practical Challenge

## Model a Company

Feel free to use the example statements from the lesson as a starting point, but they're very generic. Build them out with more fields that are tailored to your company's needs.

Some examples of how you might build the DB out include:
* Add an employees table, and a field to the orders table identifying which employee made the sale.
* Add fields to the products table to better model a company, e.g. quantity of each item in stock, item categories, colour options, sizes, etc.
* Expand the customers table with more fields, and create queries which will generate shipping labels.

Anything else you can think of.
